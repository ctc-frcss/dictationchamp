üöÄ Project Brief: Dictation Game App for Kids
App Name: Dictation Champ
üéØ Core Idea:
Build an interactive dictation game web/app for elementary school students. Users can input or upload a vocabulary word bank, and the app turns it into an engaging speech-based quiz for practice and revision.

Word Bank Input:
Let the user paste in a list of vocabulary words OR upload a .csv or .xlsx file

Start Game Logic:
After input, user clicks "Start"
App selects 10 words at random from the bank (allow repeats if under 10 words)
Question Gameplay:
Each question uses text-to-speech to pronounce a word
Show blank blocks (one for each letter) for the user to drag and drop letters to spell the word
If user struggles, allow a Hint Button that:
Shows definition OR
Reveals one correct letter
Animations & Rewards:
Add fun, colorful animations (e.g., stars, fireworks) when a question is answered correctly
Use popular cartoon-style visuals or characters to make the UI fun and engaging for children
Scoring System:
Track correct answers and display a final score / correct rate at the end
Allow exporting the result as a .csv file (e.g., word, user answer, correct/incorrect)
